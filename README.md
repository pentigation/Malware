# Worm
This code is not finished and works more like a umm worm template. This will help you get inspiration.

You can bruteforce stuff such as; ssh servers, spread with USBs, and more...


# Downloading necessary libraries 
pip install -r requirements.txt



# Executing
Windows: python worm.py
Linux: python worm.py


# Compilation(.exe)
Targeted machines probably won't have python and the required libraries installed, so to run this code on other machines, you need to convert it to an executable(exe).

To use it, type these cmds in terminal:


pip install pyinstaller

pyinstaller worm.py
